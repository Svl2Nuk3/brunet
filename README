ACIS P2P Library and Applications

Overview
===============================================================================
This library provides a basic P2P framework with the following key features:
- Transports layer (UDP, TCP, relay, XMPP, etc)
- Structured overlay layer (Symphony)
- Distributed Hash Table
- VPN (IPOP / SocialVPN / GroupVPN)
- XMLRPC Bridge
- NAT Traversal using UDP hole punching and relaying

The library has been built around mono and can be run on .NET, though special
care must be taken to actually compile the soruce in .NET.

Tests
===============================================================================
This suite contains many tests, both unit and integration tests implemented
using nunit.  An automated nunit test can be executed by using "nant test" in
the root directory.

Examples
===============================================================================
For simple examples of writing applications, navigate to the directory
src/Brunet/Applications/Examples.
